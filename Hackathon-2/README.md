In this Hackathon, we created an ensemble of Residual Neural Networks to obtain the best possible evaluation metrics on a given set of detector images from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).


Model 1: LeNet architecture with some modifications; this performed better than our other models.

Model 2: trained using the best learning parameters obtained by RandomizedSearchCV

Model 3: ResNet

Model 4: trained ResNet with the optimized learning parameter

Model 5: ensemble of 50 ResNets
