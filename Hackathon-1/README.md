In this Hackathon, we experimented with several methods to classify Higgs signal and background events. These methods include: XGBoost; SGD; decision tree; logistic regression; random forest classifier. The Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers both resulted in the highest accuracy score of 71.6% on the test set.
